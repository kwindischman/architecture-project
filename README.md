Written by Brent, Kai, and Kareem

""The goal of this project is to help you understand the internal operations of CPU caches. You are required to
simulate a Level 1 cache for a 32-bit CPU. Assume a 32-bit data bus. The cache must be command line
configurable to be direct-mapped, 2-way, 4-way, 8-way, or 16-way set associative and implement both roundrobin and random replacement policies for performance comparisons. You may implement LRU in lieu of either
of the others. ""

Three milestones:

M#1 due Apr 6: Input Parameters and Calculated Values

M#2 due Apr 27: Simulation Results

M#3 due May 7: Analysis
